// Build Employees to get the manager name need to join back on emp table - once this join happens you want to have a left join - 3 joins (1 needs to be a left join - join/left join/join) -
// JOIN combines records from two tables, locates related column values in the two tables, a query can contain zero, one, or multiple JOIN operations and INNER JOIN is the same as JOIN; the keyword INNER is optional
// > exp:
// "SELECT
// country.country_name_eng, city.city_name, customer.customer_name,
// FROM country,
// JOIN city
// ON city.country_id = country.id,
// LEFT JOIN customer
// ON customer.city_id = city.id
